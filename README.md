# DataTypeFormat_FP6_FP4
Introduction to newly announced data format and their numerical implications

Quantize Data to Embedded Efficient Floating Point Types
Recent advancement in AI processing technology put focuses on the introduction of new precision formats designed to significantly enhance training and inference performance in AI models. These microscaling data format aims to dramatically reduce the computational resources required for training and inference, leading to greener and more cost-effective AI operations.
What are FP6 or FP4? How can we use these new floating-point types? 
This example shows how to quantize data using these data format.
